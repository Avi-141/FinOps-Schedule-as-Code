# FinOps-Schedule-as-Code
Enterprises waste hours hand-coding and maintaining cron jobs for routine FinOps checks, leading to missed spend spikes and inefficient cloud costs. Every enterprise runs thousands of scheduled jobs - cost monitoring, security scans, data backups, compliance checks, performance monitoring. But they all require the same painful process: write custom scripts, configure cron syntax, build alerting logic, and maintain it forever. What if all of that could be replaced with plain English?  Let me show you how 'Check our network bandwidth usage every hour and alert if it exceeds normal patterns' becomes production-ready automation My MVP - Natural-Language FinOps Schedule-as-Code - lets users simply type in plain English (e.g. ‚ÄúEvery weekday at 2 AM UTC, check AWS EC2 spend)

# Speak2Schedule: FinOps DevOps SecOps Automation üöÄ

## Description
> **Stop Scripting, Start Commanding: Intelligent Automation for the Enterprise!**

Enterprises today are drowning in a sea of manually coded cron jobs for critical tasks ‚Äì from FinOps and cost monitoring to security scans and compliance checks. Each job represents hours of development, complex maintenance, and a frustrating reliance on specialized DevOps skills, costing millions annually in inefficiency and missed opportunities. The current reality of `0 2 * * 1-5 /scripts/check.sh --params` is simply unsustainable at scale.

The solution, **Speak2Schedule (formerly FinOps Schedule-as-Code)**, by Team NL-Ops Ninja, directly tackles this enterprise-wide challenge. Built a platform that transforms plain English commands into fully automated, production-ready monitoring jobs. Imagine typing: *"Monitor our production Kubernetes pod costs every hour. If CPU utilization for namespace 'payments' exceeds 80% for 30 minutes, alert the SRE team and suggest scaling the deployment."* ‚Äì and having that check go live instantly, without writing a single line of script or deciphering cron syntax.

### Key Achievements & Technical Depth:

* **Natural Language to Action:** We've successfully implemented an end-to-end flow where user intent, expressed in simple English, is intelligently parsed and converted into structured, executable tasks.
* **AI-Powered Core:** Leveraging OpenAI, the system's AI intelligence dissects queries to extract precise scheduling (cron), anomaly conditions, specific target services (e.g., "EC2 instances", "K8S\_POD\_1"), and actionable suggestions.
* **Robust Backend Engine:** A FastAPI backend, powered by APScheduler, manages the entire lifecycle of these checks ‚Äì from creation and dynamic scheduling to triggering execution.
* **Pluggable Multi-Data Source Architecture:** The system is designed for the diverse enterprise data landscape. We demonstrate this with functional CSV processing and multiple distinct mocked connectors for services like AWS Cost Explorer, Kubernetes, Azure, GCP, Splunk, Kibana, Datadog, and SharePoint, each returning unique datasets for targeted anomaly detection.
* **Tenant-Aware & Scalable Design:** The underlying database (SQLite for MVP) and API structure are built with multi-tenancy in mind (demonstrated with a default tenant), ready for enterprise deployment.
* **Dynamic Anomaly Detection:** My executor module applies the parsed conditions to the relevant data (filtered by target service) and can identify anomalies, such as cost spikes, as demonstrated with my dynamic "real-time" spike simulation for mock AWS data.
* **Comprehensive UI & Alerting:** A React frontend allows users to input queries, select data sources, add new (CSV/Mock) data sources, view scheduled checks with their live status, and see system-generated alerts.

### The Impact is Transformative:
We're not just saving time (from 4+ hours per job to mere seconds); we're democratizing operational automation, empowering FinOps, Security, and business teams, and enabling enterprises to become vastly more agile and cost-efficient. This project has the potential for over **$1.6M in annual savings** for an enterprise managing just 1,000 such jobs.

## Highlights:
* **Plain-English Automation:** Describe checks like ‚ÄúMonitor AWS spend hourly‚Ä¶‚Äù and AI instantly converts them into cron schedules, anomaly rules, and actionable alerts‚Äîno scripting or DevOps gatekeeping.
* **Revolutionary Natural Language to Automation Core:** The ability to take a complex operational requirement typed in plain English (e.g., "Check K8S\_POD\_1 resource costs every minute. If cost for 'K8S\_POD\_1' exceeds $70, recommend optimizing pod requests.") and instantly translate it into a fully structured, scheduled, and executable monitoring job. This eliminates manual scripting and cron syntax entirely.
* **Enterprise-Ready Multi-Data Source Architecture:** Designed with a pluggable architecture to connect with a diverse range of enterprise data sources (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Log Platforms, SharePoint, CSVs). The MVP demonstrates this with functional CSV processing and multiple, distinct mocked connectors, proving the system's capability to dispatch tasks and handle varied data.
